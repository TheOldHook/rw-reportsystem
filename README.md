# rw-reportsystem
A report system for QBCore from the inside (ingame) to Discord (webhook).

The language is currently Norwegian and also the report command which is '/rapporter' in the chat but this can be changed to what you prefer. 
Webhook is currently to be changed in server.lua for your desired discord channel!
I made this script 6 months ago to start learning about lua and nui, the nui is based on Jevas tutorial.

When the player opens the menu, the person can see information about their job, id and license.
